2024 Formalization of Mathematics Workshop @ the Hausdorff Center for Mathematics, Bonn, Germany

**Abstract**: Beauty in mathematics may or may not be a concept that is formalizable, but beauty is clearly critical for effective formalization. In the context of mechanization of mathematics that has been ongoing over the last four decades, the criterion for beauty needs to be adapted from that of informal mathematics. Beautiful informal arguments might turn out to be less than elegant when formalized, and conversely, the austere beauty of mechanized mathematics might defy conventional standards. In the context of mechanization, particularly the use of decision procedures, a beautiful formalization is one that elegantly leverages the power of formal language and automation to deliver clear, concise, and general definitions and proofs. We illustrate our approach to the aesthetics of formalization with examples.

PODELSKI Workshop @ PLDI 2024

**Abstract**: The traditional view is that theorem provers, and automated reasoning tools in general, serve as back-ends to other user-facing tools. In this talk, I outline an alternative view where one interacts directly with a theorem prover by embedding the syntax and semantics of other formalisms/tools within this medium. Both views can happily coexist, but there are many advantages, and some disadvantages, to living entirely within a theorem proving universe. We speculate on what life might look like inside such a universe.

Topos Institute Colloquium, 31st of August 2023

**Abstract**: Logic has always played a central role in computing.  One successful application of logic is its use in specifying and modeling computational behavior, and in proving properties of computation systems.  SRI's PVS was released thirty years ago with the goal of democratizing interactive theorem proving by combining an expressive formalism with powerful automated reasoning tools for building and maintaining complex formalizations and proofs.  We describe some of the features of PVS for defining and reasoning with mathematical abstractions and bridging the gap between informal and formalized mathematical discourse.  PVS features an expressive-order logic with algebraic/coalgebraic datatypes, dependent predicate subtypes, and parametric theories.  The interactive theorem prover employs a range of automated proof strategies for simplification, rewriting, and case analysis, along with built-in decision procedures for SAT and SMT solving.  The applicative fragment of PVS can be viewed as a functional programming language, and efficient executable code can be generated in Common Lisp and C, among other languages.  PVS includes extensive libraries spanning a range of topics in mathematics and computing.  The talk is an informal overview of the underlying theoretical foundations, and the proof and code generation capabilities of PVS.

Invited Seminar @ IIT Bombay Trust Lab 2023

**Abstract**: The versatility and flexibility of software makes it an indispensable tool for building critical systems, but its inherent complexity opens up vulnerabilities that can compromise safety and security.  High-assurance software systems must be designed with rigorous claims supported by reliable and reproducible evidence and efficient arguments that magnify the salience of potential flaws and weaknesses.  We motivate the need for constructing software hand-in-hand with an assurance argument supporting the critical safety and security claims.  We describe some technologies that we have been developing to assist with design for assurance.  Specifically, we outline the ``efficient argument'' approach to system design, the use of formal architectures as a foundation for efficient compositional arguments, ontic type analysis linking the requirements ontology to code-level representations, automatic code generation from high-level specifications, and the Evidential Tool Bus (ETB) architecture for integrating evidence-generating tools within a design workflow for building and maintaining assurance arguments.
