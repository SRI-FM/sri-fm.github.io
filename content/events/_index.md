{{< dropdown-title title="Summer School for Formal Techniques" >}}

The yearly Summer School on Formal Techniques, organized by the SRI Formal Methods Program,
focuses on the principles and practice of formal techniques with a strong emphasis on hands-on use and development. 
It is primarily designed for graduate students and young researchers interested in studying and applying formal techniques in their work.
Participants can expect to experiment with tools and techniques presented in lectures during laboratory sessions.

For more information, please visit the [Website](https://ssft-sri.github.io/), which includes all lectures since 2011.

{{< dropdown-title title="Formal Methods Lounge" >}}

The Formal Methods Lounge is an internal seminar series at SRI on Formal Techniques and its Application to 
Resilient Software (including AI/ML) and High-Assurance Systems.

We plan to open it more and more to the interested public by announcing 
talks on this website and sending links for online participation to registered parties.
Stay tuned.

{{< dropdown-title title="PVS Day" >}}

[PVS Day](https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/nfm2025/pvs-day.html) 
is an exciting and collaborative workshop dedicated to the Prototype Verification System (PVS), 
the legendary formal verification system developed by SRI International and supported by NASA.

Co-located with [NASA's Formal Methods (NFM)](https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/nfm2025/) conference, 
this event brings together PVS users, 
practitioners, and enthusiasts worldwide. 

The workshop features expert talks on the latest work and innovations with PVS, 
opportunities for community building, panel discussions on the future of theorem proving, 
and showcases diverse applications of PVS in various domains. 
It serves as a unique opportunity for both seasoned users and newcomers to learn, 
connect, and contribute to advancing formal verification.

{{< dropdown-title title= "Big Proof and Big Specification" >}}

The *Big Proofs* and *Big Specification* workshop series at the Isaac Newton Institute addresses the critical challenges 
in formalizing mathematical concepts and developing robust specifications for complex computer systems. 
These workshops bring together leading experts to discuss pragmatic foundations, scalable proof automation, 
and the application of formal methods to real-world engineering problems. 
Natarajan Shankar from SRI International plays a key organizational role in these events, 
highlighting SRI's significant contribution to advancing the fields of formal verification 
and large-scale mathematical formalization.

The [Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://www.newton.ac.uk/) hosts the *Big Proof* series, which focuses on the ambitious goal of formalizing mathematics at scale. This initiative brings together mathematicians, logicians, and computer scientists to explore new foundations, develop scalable proof automation, and investigate the role of machine learning in formal proof.

You can find more details and specific workshops within the series on the Isaac Newton Institute's website:
