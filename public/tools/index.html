<h1 id="etb---evidential-toolbus">ETB - Evidential Toolbus</h1>
<h2 id="description-3">Description</h2>
<p>Distributed framework for integrating various software systems analysis and verification tools.
Designed to facilitate the continuous creation and maintenance of assurance cases, automatically updating claims
and evidence as system requirements or components change.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-3">Purpose</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of ETB is to significantly reduce the cost, labor, and <em>ad hoc</em> nature of developing and
maintaining assurance cases for critical systems. By automating the evidence generation and argument construction processes,
it aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide <em>accountable evidence</em> that corroborates the safety and other critical properties of software.</li>
<li>Enable <em>continuous assurance</em> for complex systems, where traditional manual processes are unsustainable.</li>
<li>Improve <em>rigor and trustworthiness</em> of assurance cases by grounding them in formal logic and verifiable evidence.</li>

<h1 id="assurance-20---rigorous-assurance-cases">Assurance 2.0 - Rigorous Assurance Cases</h1>
<h2 id="description-4">Description</h2>
<p>Modern approach to the development and assessment of assurance cases, which are structured arguments backed by evidence to demonstrate that a system possesses certain critical properties (e.g., safety, security).
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10665">Assurance 2.0</a> builds upon the established Claims, Arguments, Evidence methodology but introduces a higher degree of rigor and systematic evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical Soundness  of the decomposition of claims into subclaims</li>
<li>Identification, analysis, and refutation of potential defeaters (challenges or doubts) to the argument</li>
<li>Probabilistic assessment of residual risks</li>
<li>Confirmation theory:  does evidence support a claim?  how well does it discriminate against alternative claims?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="purpose-4">Purpose</h2>
<p>Provide a robust framework for justified confidence in the deployment of complex, critical systems,
especially those incorporating new technologies like AI and autonomous capabilities, where traditional testing alone is insufficient.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases-4">Use Cases</h2>
<p>Certification of Safety-Critical Systems, Security Assurance, AI Assurance, Regulatory Compliance, Continuous and Incremental Assurance.</p>
<h2 id="tool-support">Tool Support</h2>
<p>The Assurance 2.0 methodology is usually implemented in industry-specific development frameworks, with
<a href="https://github.com/SRI-CSL/etb2">ETB</a> used for curating evidence in CI/CD pipelines. We have been cooperating
with Adelard (now part of <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/">NCC group</a> in developing <em>Clarissa</em>, which directly
supports Assurance 2.0.</p>

and it uses maximum a posterior inference, allowing it to achieve scalability for larger problems.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-5">Purpose</h2>
<p>Enable logical reasoning about systems where uncertainty and probabilities are inherent.
This is crucial for analyzing and verifying systems where components might fail with a certain probability,
or where decisions are based on uncertain inputs. It helps in modeling and analyzing probabilistic systems,
consistency checking of probabilistic statements, and probabilistic inference.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases-5">Use Cases</h2>
<p>Probabilistic program analysis, information extraction and integration, knowledge base construction, natural language processing, semantic parsing, social network analysis, computer vision, computational biology, robotics and autonomous systems, fraud detection, cybersecurity.</p>
